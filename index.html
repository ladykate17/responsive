			<h2>Are you a fan of delicious flavor?</h2>
			<p>Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! While he was eating, did you hear anyone laughing? Like... in the kitchen area? Yes! Yes I did, actually, yes I did. That'd be trouser food! No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past? When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory! You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. I don't see how they couldn't just keep it as it was. How hard is it to remember 911?</p>
			
			<p>It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory! Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. How long have you been disabled? Ten years? Ten years, and how did it happen? If that's not a rude question. Acid?</p>

			<p>Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on. I don't see how they couldn't just keep it as it was. How hard is it to remember 911? Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss. From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes.</p>
